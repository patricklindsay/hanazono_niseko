				<h2 class="type2 mb">WHAT SHOULD I BRING WITH ME?</h2>
				<div class="inner intxt">
					<p><span class="black c3">BACKPACK: </span>We will prepare several backpacks with avalanche safety equipment. You need not bring your own backpack. Bags and/or backpacks with snacks, drinks, cameras etc. can be kept in the snow CAT during the tour.</p>
					<p><span class="black c3">AVALANCHE BEACON: </span>We ask all participants to carry an avalanche beacon, which are available to borrow free of charge. If you have your own beacon, we recommend you bring your own as it is better to have a beacon you are familiar with. Please make sure your beacon is fully charged.</p>
					<p><span class="black c3">SNOW PROBE &amp; SHOVEL: </span>We will prepare several sets of probes & shovels and will ask several participants to carry one of them in a backpack during the tour.</p>
					<p><span class="black c3">SKI POLES: </span>For skiers, ski poles with powder baskets are recommended.</p>
					<p><span class="black c3">SKI WEAR: </span>We recommend guests bring an extra pair of inner-layers as the temperature may change suddenly.</p>
					<p><span class="black c3">FACEMASK &amp; NECK WARMER: </span>We recommend that you wear or carry a facemask and neck warmer.</p>
					<p><span class="black c3">GLOVES: </span>Please choose warm and well fitting gloves.</p>
					<p><span class="black c3">HELMET: </span>Helmets save lives. Helmets prevent injury when falling or  crashing, and even protect from wayward tree branches. We strongly recommend all guests wear helmets.</p>
					<p><span class="black c3">GOGGLES &amp; SUNGLASSES: </span>There will be no hike-up on our CAT tour so a pair of sunglasses is not necessary. It's recommended you bring along a spare set of goggles.</p>
					<p><span class="black c3">GOPRO &amp; SPORTCAM: </span>You are more than welcome to bring these along with you. Share your powder day with friends and family!</p>

					<p>NISEKO WEISS POWDER CATS is a tour that rides Niseko’s world famous powder all day long. We strongly recommend the usage of powder skis/snowboards.</p>

				<h2 class="type2 mb">HOW ARE THE RUNS LIKE?</h2>
				<div class="inner intxt">
					<p>You would be able to run an average of 6-7 runs in one tour.<br/>The steepest run would be 30 degrees and an average would be 20 degrees.<br/>The maximum vertical decent would be 450 meters.</p>
					<p>Though the amount and quality of snow here is magnificent, the altitude is not high so there are no worries of thin air. The CAT base, where the tour would begin, is located 450 meters above sea level and the peak drop-off is 930 meters above sea level.</p>

				<h2 class="type2 mb">WHEN IS THE BEST TIME FOR POWDER IN NISEKO?</h2>
				<div class="inner intxt">
					<p>Niseko’s winter season runs from late November to Early May; the peak powder period is typically from mid January until the end of February, although this varies every season. <br />
					In March, it starts to get a little difficult to find fresh powder in the Niseko ski areas as there are so many guests sharing the same ski area.</p>
					<p>But at Mt. Weisshorn, the whole mountain is used by exclusively by our guests. This allows access to fresh snow even in early to mid March.</p>
				</div>
			</div><!--/box.theme10-->
			
			<div class="box theme10">
				<h2 class="type2 mb">HPG OR NISEKO WEISS POWDER CATS?</h2>
				<div class="inner intxt">
					<p>If you are a powder-hound that just can’t get enough powder, you should request HANAZONO Powder Guide’s “POWDER 3 DAYZ” program, no question. <br />
					For groups of friends or family travelling together that are at similar skiing/snowboarding levels, perhaps a “HPG Private Tour” would be more relaxing as you all know each other’s personality and skiing/snowboarding abilities.</p>
					<p>What makes NISEKO WEISS POWDER CATS unique is the you don’t need to rush or hurry or worry to get fresh tracks. The entire mountain is shared with only 12 guests (plus our guides!). </p>
