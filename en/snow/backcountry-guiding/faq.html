				<h1 class="type1 c1 mb lh1"><small class="c2">BACKCOUNTRY GUIDING - HANAZONO POWDER GUIDES</small>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</h1>
				<h2 class="type2 mb">WHAT DO I NEED TO JOIN A BACKCOUNTRY TOUR?</h2>
				<div class="inner intxt">
					<p><span class="black c2">BACKPACK:</span> We recommend backpacks that have a ski/snowboard carry. (Please consult with one of our guides if you do not have one). If you have bought a new backpack please ensure you are familiar with strapping on and off your skis/snowboard before the tour.</p>
					<p><span class="black c2">AVALANCHE BEACON:</span> We ask all participants to carry an avalanche beacon, which are available for rent free of charge. If you have one, we recommend bringing your own (fully charged) beacon that you are familiar with.</p>
					<p><span class="black c2">SNOW PROBE &amp; SHOVEL:</span> Though recommended, we do not require our guests to carry a probe and shovel. If you are in the habit of carrying them, please bring them along. We have a limited number available for rent free of charge.</p>
					<p><span class="black c2">SKI POLES:</span> For skiers, ski poles with powder baskets are recommended. For advanced levels of snowboarders, telescopic or fold down poles will be useful as we may ask you to traverse some distance to find untracked snow. We have a limited number of new K2 Speed Link Poles available for rent free of charge.</p>
					<p><span class="black c2">SKIWEAR:</span> Regular ski/snowboard wear and spare inner-layers are recommended. Temperatures can drop to below minus 15C in midwinter. Windchill can see these temperatures drop even further, beyond minus 20C. We strongly recommend that you bring extra inner-layers of clothing.</p>
					<p><span class="black c2">FACEMASK &amp; NECK WARMER:</span> We recommend that you wear or carry a facemask and neck warmer.</p>
					<p><span class="black c2">GLOVES:</span> Please choose warm and well fitting gloves.</p>
					<p><span class="black c2">HELMET:</span> Please wear a helmet. With so many accessible three runs, helmets are highly recommended in Niseko. They can prevent injury from falling, crashing, or even a wayward tree branch. We request all children wear helmets.</p>
					<p><span class="black c2">GOGGLES &amp; SUNGLASSES:</span> What you would normally wear skiing or snowboarding is fine, although we generally recommend a good pair of goggles, for greater protection and visibility. Outside of spring season, a bright colored lens is recommended as we have very few sunny days during high season. We have a variety of K2, Oakley and Smith goggles and spare lens suitable for Niseko at Niseko Sports outlets in Hirafu and Hanazono.</p>

				<h2 class="type2 mb">DO I NEED POWDER SPECIFIC SKIS OR SNOWBOARD?</h2>
				<div class="inner intxt">
					<p>Regular skis or snowboards are fine for exploring, but if you have come exclusively for the backcountry in Niseko, we recommend a powder ski/snowboard.</p>
					<p><span class="black c2">SKIERS:</span> 80mm waist and over all-round ski is fine, but why not try a set of rocker skis? Rockered skis provide improved flotation on Niseko&apos;s deep powder, they turn quickly (handy when in trees) and stop swiftly.</p>
					<p><span class="black c2">SNOWBOARDERS:</span> You might struggle if your snowboard has a regular camber and freestyle stance setup. A 5-10cm setback is generally recommended. Similar to skis, if you are here for powder snow, we recommend you try a snowboard designed for powder. The BURTON S-Rocker or Fish is very popular among guests at rental shops. Hokkaido branded snowboards are also popular.</p>
					<p><span class="black c2">NISEKO SPORTS EQUIPMENT HIRE:</span> Talk to our friendly staff at Niseko Sports Equipment Hire at Hanazono 308, Hirafu or The Vale Snowsports for advice and more information on powder skis/snowboards.</p>
					<p>Niseko Sports has a wide variety of skis/snowboards, including BURTON, K2 and SALOMON which all have a range of popular powder skis/snowboards. Recommendations for snowboarders are BURTON Barracuda and Fish, K2 and RIDE powder series. For skiers, K2 Backside series, K2 All Mountain series, LINE signature models, SALOMON BBR and Rocker series. Also in stock are the popular K2 Side Seth line, and women&apos;s K2 Miss directed skis in season 2012-13.</p>
					<p>Niseko Sports offers the convenient option to switch your ski/snowboards, or even skis to snowboard or vice versa as many times as you like, at any Niseko Sports outlet.</p>

				<h2 class="type2 mb">WHEN IS THE BEST TIME FOR POWDER IN NISEKO?</h2>
				<div class="inner intxt">
					<p>Niseko&apos;s winter season runs from late November to Early May, the peak powder period is typically from late December to mid February, although this varies every season. An annual average 4 metre snow base ensures great Spring conditions from March onwards.</p>
					<p><span class="black c2">START OF THE SEASON:</span> The first snowfalls of the year in Niseko are usually in late October through to Early November. As temperatures drop and storm cells intensify throughout November, the snow begins to fall to lower elevations, blanketing the entire mountain white with snow. As snowfalls increase, and a base is formed the upper part of the resort becomes skiable - the beginning of the ski season.</p>
					<p>Winter storms pushing out of Siberia become more frequent from early December, covering small bushes and Sasa grass, this is a surprisingly good time to visit Niseko; with relatively few skiers/riders you will find powder stashes almost everywhere within the resort boundary.</p>
					<p><span class="black c2">HIGH SEASON:</span> Most backcountry gates open around the Christmas period. This time through to mid February is the absolute best time of season for light &amp; dry powder.</p>
					<p>If you wish to ski/snowboard deep and dry powder like you see in magazines or DVDs, we assure you, this is the best time of year.</p>
					<p>Family visitors leave Niseko around mid January and in their place, powder enthusiasts from all over the world flood into Niseko. This time of year, although snow quality is particularly good, the lifts can be frequently affected by the weather. When upper mountain areas are closed due to weather conditions, you still can enjoy Niseko&apos;s powder line riding lower lifts.</p>
					<p>After mid February, bottomless dry powder gradually changes to creamy, slightly heavier powder snow.</p>
					<p><span class="black c2">SPRING SEASON:</span> The weather usually starts to become stable in March, offering good conditions for backcountry, with more sunny days and better visibility, hiking up to the peak is a joy.</p>
					<p>In April, snow fall decreases but the snow base is still very high. Skiing / riding down through corn snow on a warm spring day is exceptional. Gates will close if there is a high risk of slab avalanche.</p>
